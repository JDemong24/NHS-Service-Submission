<h1>Updates for 2023</h1>

<h2>Amusement Park Theme</h2>

<p>
    The puzzles in the 2023 Pi Day Challenge are centered around an amusement park. Ride the ferris
    wheel, throw darts at balloons, or watch a magic show! The puzzles range from simple arithmetic
    and logic to algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. There's even some physics. Have fun and good
    luck!
</p>

<h2>Private Leader Boards</h2>

<p>
    This year we have an exciting new feature: Private Leader Boards! Now anyone can create their
    own mini version of the Genius Board and invite their friends to join. Everyone in the group
    will be able to see how many puzzles the other members have solved. This is a fun way for
    teachers to turn the Pi Day Challenge into a classroom competition!
</p>

<p>
    Here's how they work: login and click
    <strong><a href="index.php?content=geniusBoard">Genius Board</a></strong>
    in the navigation bar and then click
    <strong><a href="index.php?content=leaderBoard">Access Private Leader Boards</a></strong>.
    Click the <strong>Create a Private Leader Board</strong> button and give it a name.
</p>

<p>
    Once created, share the <strong>Join Code</strong> with your students, friends, or family. They
    can join from their account by visiting the same page and clicking the
    <strong>Join a Private Leader Board</strong> button. All members of the leader board will see
    how many puzzles everyone else has completed.
